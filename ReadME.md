# Computer Graphics WebGL Modelling Coursework

## How to run it
To run the model just click on the index.html and open it in your browser (tested with chrome, firefox and edge). The controls to the system are shown alongside/below the model canvas.

## Included Features
The model has all 3 axes of rotation, 6 plane camera movement and a movable car and boat (the car's wheels also rotate as it moves along). It uses a directional light as well as some ambient lighting and includes models of the boat club, some boats, elvet bridge and a car (with grass and floors around too). 
In the "Old Versions" Folder included there are some attempts at texture mapping which all ended in errors (some caused by CORS and others cause by the uniforms in the shader not being able to be accessed or changed correctly).
